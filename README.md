# Chrome New Tab :recycle:

This Chrome browser extension overwrites your new tab page and adds some useful shortcuts / workflows.

## Description

Started in 2019, this was my first real project in Computer Science.  I started it out as a simple time waster but I eventually added shortcuts and workflows using the Chrome API to manage tabs as well as create tab workups.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The mp3 files can be pretty heavy, but i'm sure you can see why having them would be important.

### Installing
  
* Best advice I could give you would be to clone this and then simply open the index.html file locally, I am looking into web hosting for the future.

### Executing program

* Click the play button on whichever track you want.
